# NewsAPI Research & Implementation Guide (MVP)

## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to researching and implementing NewsAPI for Franklin Terminal MVP. NewsAPI is an aggregator and search engine for thousands of news sources, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and broad coverage.

## 🔍 **Research Checklist for NewsAPI**

### 1. **API Documentation & Access**

- [ ] Find official API documentation
- [ ] Check if API key is required
- [ ] Understand authentication methods
- [ ] Review rate limits and pricing
- [ ] Test API endpoints manually (Postman/curl)

### 2. **Data Structure Analysis**

- [ ] Map API response fields to our schema
- [ ] Identify required vs optional fields
- [ ] Note any data transformations needed
- [ ] Check for nested data structures
- [ ] Verify date/time formats

### 3. **Query Capabilities**

- [ ] What filtering options are available?
- [ ] Can you search by keywords/topics?
- [ ] Are there category/tag filters?
- [ ] Can you limit results by date range?
- [ ] What sorting options exist?

### 4. **Rate Limiting & Reliability**

- [ ] What are the rate limits?
- [ ] How are rate limits enforced?
- [ ] What happens when limits are exceeded?
- [ ] Are there retry mechanisms?
- [ ] What's the typical response time?

## 📊 **NewsAPI Research Tasks**

**Status**: Free tier available, good documentation

**Research Tasks**:

- [ ] Sign up for free API key at https://newsapi.org/
- [ ] Test `/v2/everything` endpoint for keyword search
- [ ] Test `/v2/top-headlines` for category-based news
- [ ] Verify political/economic news categories
- [ ] Check if content is full-text or summary only
- [ ] Test date range filtering capabilities

**Key Questions**:

- Can we filter by political/economic topics specifically?
- What's the quality of content summaries?
- Are there any content restrictions?

## 🛠 **Implementation Strategy**

### **MVP Phase: NewsAPI Only**

- Implement NewsAPI handler as the only source
- Use query builder to generate NewsAPI queries from user preferences
- Validate and transform NewsAPI responses to standardized schema
- Add error handling, rate limiting, and logging

## 📋 **Implementation Checklist**

- [ ] Implement NewsAPI handler
- [ ] Implement query builder for NewsAPI
- [ ] Validate data transformation
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Test with real API credentials
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios

## 🔧 **Testing Strategy**

- [ ] Test NewsAPI handler independently
- [ ] Mock API responses for consistent testing
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Validate data transformation logic
- [ ] Test full pipeline with NewsAPI only

## 📚 **Resources & References**

- [NewsAPI Documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API testing
- [curl](https://curl.se/) - Command line API testing

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] NewsAPI returns valid data
- [ ] Error handling works for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly enforced
- [ ] Data transformation produces consistent results
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Briefings contain relevant, high-quality content
- [ ] User preferences are properly reflected
- [ ] Real-time updates work reliably
- [ ] System scales with user growth

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Start with NewsAPI** - Get free API key and test endpoints
2. **Implement NewsAPI handler and query builder**
3. **Test and validate data flow**
4. **Monitor and optimize** - Track performance and improve over time
