- What's the content quality and relevance?

### **Bloomberg RSS** (Priority: MEDIUM - Optional)

**Status**: Public RSS feeds, no API key required

**Research Tasks**:

- [ ] Test RSS feed parsing: https://feeds.bloomberg.com/politics/news.rss
- [ ] Compare content quality with other sources
- [ ] Check update frequency
- [ ] Test content extraction capabilities
- [ ] Verify political/economic focus

**Key Questions**:

- How does Bloomberg's political coverage compare to other sources?
- What's the update frequency?
- Can we extract meaningful content from the RSS feed?

### **Reuters API** (Priority: LOW - Optional)

**Status**: Paid service, may require enterprise access

**Research Tasks**:

- [ ] Check if Reuters offers public API access
- [ ] Research pricing and access requirements
- [ ] Test any available demo endpoints
- [ ] Compare with free alternatives
- [ ] Evaluate cost-benefit ratio

**Key Questions**:

- Is Reuters API accessible for our use case?
- What's the cost compared to value?
- Are there free alternatives that provide similar value?

## üõ† **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Start with Free Sources**

1. **NewsAPI** - Implement first (most comprehensive)
2. **FRED** - Implement second (unique economic data)
3. **Politico RSS** - Implement third (good political focus)

### **Phase 2: Evaluate Paid Sources**

1. **Bloomberg RSS** - Test and compare with Politico
2. **Reuters API** - Research feasibility and cost

### **Phase 3: Optimization**

1. Compare data quality across sources
2. Optimize query strategies
3. Implement source-specific relevance scoring

## üìã **Implementation Checklist**

### **For Each Source Handler**:

- [ ] Update skeleton with real API integration
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] Test with real API credentials
- [ ] Validate data transformation
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios

### **For Query Builder**:

- [ ] Research source-specific query capabilities
- [ ] Implement intelligent query generation
- [ ] Add query optimization logic
- [ ] Test with various user profiles
- [ ] Validate query performance

### **For Data Pipeline**:

- [ ] Test end-to-end data flow
- [ ] Validate data quality and consistency
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Monitor performance and resource usage
- [ ] Implement data validation and cleaning

## üîß **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing**:

- [ ] Test each handler independently
- [ ] Mock API responses for consistent testing
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Validate data transformation logic

### **Integration Testing**:
